# TextRPG

The objective of this project is to combine my current knowledge of Java programming and also apply it to developing my own games. In this
case, a SUD (Single-User Dungeon) Lol! Eventually I'd like to continue the development of this game into 2D, Multiplayer, etc; however, it will be on a much smaller scale.

Feel free to offer advice or join in on the fun if you'd like. If you are in the same situation as me, maybe you can utilize some of the 
code for your own benefit.

At this time I just want to focus small and build, build, build. In the future, I'd like to upload my design documents as they are made to this repository, along with functionality that I'd like to eventually add.
